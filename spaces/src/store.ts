 * that survives a real document and one that does not: measured on a 200-page,
 * 2.5 MB handbook, whole-document entries gave a depth of NINE — fifty edits,
 * and you can take back the last nine — because every checkpoint stringified
 * 2.5 MB against a 24 MB budget. The same budget holds hundreds of page
 * entries, and a page entry costs ~12 KB rather than 2.5 MB to take.
 *
 * DOC IS THE DEFAULT, and page scope is opted into. A page entry restores one
 * page by id and leaves the rest of the document alone, so it is only correct
 * when the mutation touched nothing else — the caller knows that and the store
 * cannot cheaply check it. Defaulting the other way would corrupt undo for any
 * caller that forgot.
