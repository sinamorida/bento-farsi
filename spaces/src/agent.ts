// The agent surface: what `window.bento` reports, and how it is patched.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. An agent authoring a space is working blind in a way a human
// author is not. Everything that goes wrong here goes wrong SILENTLY: a link to
// a page that was renamed away still looks like a link in the JSON, a `<p>` in
// a block's html is unwrapped at render with no complaint, an unknown block
// type falls back to its text, an `asset:` reference that nothing points at is
// just megabytes. None of it throws, and none of it is visible in the document
// the agent just wrote. `validate()` is the pass that says so out loud.
//
// The other half is writing. Before this, the only structural verbs were
// `insertBlocks` and `newPage`; everything else meant `loadDoc(JSON.stringify(
// wholeDocument))`, which flattens undo to one entry, clobbers whatever a human
// typed while the agent was thinking, and re-mints nothing but is trusted with
// everything. The verbs here are each ONE undoable step and touch only what
// they name.
//
// THE INVARIANT THAT SHAPES THIS FILE: an agent must not be able to write a
// document this build could not itself have produced. So html goes through the
// sanitizer on the way IN (not only on the way to the screen), a patch value
// that JSON cannot carry is refused rather than silently dropped at save time,
// and a page can never be left with zero blocks — the editor has no way to
// place a caret in one, so it would be a page nobody can ever type in again.
//
// PLAN/APPLY. Every write verb returns a PLAN: it validates against the
// document and hands back a thunk. `store.commit` checkpoints undo BEFORE it
// mutates, so planning inside a commit would mean a refused patch still pushed
// an undo entry that undoes nothing. Planning first also makes the whole write
// path testable in node, where there is no store and no DOM.
