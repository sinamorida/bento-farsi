// Takes the vite single-file build, extracts the big inline module script and
// stylesheet, deflates them (raw) into base64 payload blocks, and restructures
// the document into the canonical byte order:
//
//   head chrome → NOTICE → tooling comment → #bento-doc (PLAINTEXT, always)
//   → splash (paints while the payload parses) → payloads + 1KB loader last
//
// The loader inflates via the native DecompressionStream and boots the module
// from a blob URL. Browsers without DecompressionStream (pre-2023 Safari) get
// a plain-HTML message instead of a blank page.
//
// COMPATIBILITY CONTRACT (老 updaters are frozen code — we conform to them):
//   - #bento-doc stays plaintext with the same id.
//   - The whole file survives DOMParser → splice → outerHTML round-trips.
//   - No literal "</script>" anywhere (base64 alphabet can't produce one;
//     the loader is checked below).
// release.mjs runs a frozen v0.1.0-style splice against the output as a gate.

 * ZOPFLI, not zlib.
 *
 * Zopfli emits a stream in the SAME deflate format, just packed harder — so
 * the shipped loader is untouched, every already-saved file keeps working, and
 * old updaters splicing into a new shell see exactly what they saw before.
 * Verified rather than assumed: a zopfli payload handed to Chrome 148's native
 * `DecompressionStream('deflate-raw')` inflated to a byte-identical result,
 * SHA-256 matched, in 2.2 ms.
 *
 * Measured on the shipped shells: 172,470 -> 165,398 B for bento/spaces and
 * 690,060 -> 663,760 B for bento/slides. About 4% off every file anyone saves,
 * for a second of build time.
 *
 * RESOLVED FROM THE CALLER, not from this file. This script lives in scripts/
 * and there is no package.json there or at the root, so a bare import would
 * look in the wrong place; every app runs it from its OWN directory, which is
 * where the dependency is declared. That is also why the failure below names
 * the fix rather than falling back silently — a release quietly built 4%
 * larger because someone's node_modules was stale is a regression nobody would
 * ever notice.

  THE MECHANICS
  · The document is the ONE script block of type "application/bento+json",
    id "bento-doc", below — plain readable JSON. Edit THAT block in place;
    never regenerate the whole file. Escape every "<" in the JSON as \\u003c.
  · The base64 blocks near the end are the DEFLATE-compressed app runtime
    (open source, https://bento.page) — no user content, leave them alone.
  · In a running file, window.bento exposes { doc, serialize(), loadDoc(json),
    comments(), updates, i18n }. In the app UI: Save → Copy / Replace JSON.
  · Schema: https://bento.page/schema/slides.json (= window.bento.schema()); agent index: https://bento.page/llms.txt

  MAKE A GREAT DECK, NOT JUST A CORRECT ONE
  Bento's whole point is motion + interactivity. A wall of text slides wastes
  it. When the source material contains ↓, reach for the feature:
  · numbers to compare visually (trend, magnitude, share)  →  a CHART
      element (preset bar|line|pie|scatter). Never list data as bullet text.
  · a comparison / spec / pricing / feature grid  →  a TABLE element
      (columns[] + rows[] of cells + a style object). Not a pile of textboxes.
  · consecutive slides about the SAME thing changing (before/after, process
    steps, a metric across stages)  →  give the shared elements the SAME id
    on both slides and set the later slide's transition to "morph". This is
    Bento's signature move — use it liberally; it is almost always missed.
  · a point to drill into (a definition, "click to see how")  →  a STATE
    slide (stateOf: "<parent-id>" + an element link: "<state-id>").
  · a hero / full-slide image  →  full-bleed image (0,0,1280,720) + a scrim
    rect + text on top, with a slow ken-burns drift
      (fx:{ambient:"kenburns",ken:{dir:"drift",scale:1.08,duration:20}}).
  · a sequence / flow / timeline / connection  →  a line or path with a
    loop (fx:{loop:{type:"dash-march",...}}), or morph a highlight through it.
  · a headline number  →  big, with fx:{countUp:true}.
  · every cover / section divider  →  at least ONE ambient motion so it is
    not dead static.
  · repeated chrome or a logo  →  keep its id stable across slides so it
    morphs in place instead of popping.

  BEFORE YOU FINISH — self-audit:
  [ ] any numbers rendered as text that should be a chart?
  [ ] do consecutive slides on one subject share ids + transition:"morph"?
  [ ] at least one motion moment (ken-burns / loop / count-up), esp. the cover?
  [ ] a drill-down that would work better as a state slide?
  [ ] one accent colour, at most two typefaces, 96px side margins?
  [ ] speaker notes written (they travel in the file)?

// Every Bento app must point agents at the document block and the scripting
// API (docs/PLATFORM.md §7). Apps beyond slides get this short form until
// they have authoring guidance of their own worth shipping in every file.
