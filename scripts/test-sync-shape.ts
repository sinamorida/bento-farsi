// WHAT THIS IS FOR. scripts/test-sync-equiv.ts proves the parameterized engine
// still mints the bytes every shipped bento/slides file was written with — it
// is a NEGATIVE property, and a parameterization that quietly did nothing
// would sail through it. Nothing yet proved the POSITIVE one: that binding a
// second shape produces an engine that actually works on a document of that
// shape.
//
// This is that check, and it is deliberately small. The full bento/spaces
// convergence rig belongs with the spaces binding; what belongs here is the
// evidence that the seam is real — because the seam is what the whole
// collaboration project rests on, and "it compiles" is not evidence.
//
// It is also where the constructor contract is pinned: the engine takes its
// shape with NO DEFAULT. A default is precisely how a spaces call site ends up
// silently holding slides' shape, and the resulting room cannot be repaired in
// the field.

// bento/spaces will not stamp `txt`: a space is typed prose, and the token
// history costs ×25.8 of the text when it is typed (×0.2 when pasted — the RGA
// only engages for text somebody typed while a session ran). What must be true
// for that to be a safe choice, and is asserted here rather than assumed:
//
//   1. slides is untouched — the default still emits `txt`, byte for byte;
//   2. omitting it actually shrinks the stamp, by the order claimed;
//   3. a state restored WITHOUT it still CONVERGES. Only the granularity
//      degrades: last-writer-wins per block instead of per character.
//
// (3) is the one that would sink the idea, so it is measured, not argued.
