// ONE RELAY, ONE WIRE FORMAT, TWO CLIENTS — asserted rather than hoped.
//
// `dash/src/sync/online.ts` says of itself that it is "A PORT of
// slides/src/sync/online.ts, deliberately close to the original". That transport
// has since moved into `kernel/src/sync/online.ts`, so the port's twin now lives
// in the kernel — and the two files are still separate text that nobody diffs.
//
// WHY THEY ARE STILL SEPARATE, so the next person does not "fix" it in an
// afternoon: dash's `OnlineTransport` is parameterised by `DashDoc` and dash's
// `SyncStateJSON` and takes a differently-shaped hooks object, because
// `DashSync` is not a `SyncEngine` subclass — dash runs a different CRDT engine
// on purpose (sparse per-row state, so an untouched row costs nothing in the
// saved file; the kernel engine would put O(rows) in every workbook). Making one
// call the other is a genericisation of the transport over the doc and state
// types, not a facade, and it is the kind of change that breaks relay auth
// quietly.
//
// WHAT MUST NOT FORK IS THE PROTOCOL. A deployed worker verifies these exact
// strings: it pins the room id to a public key, walks an owner→invite→member
// signature chain, and drops any persisted frame without a valid signature. If
// one client's idea of `inv.${pub}.${role}.${exp}` ever drifts from the other's,
// the symptom is not a failing test — it is one app's users silently unable to
// join the other's rooms, discovered in production, on a relay that cannot be
// rolled back independently of the shells already in people's files.
//
// So this rig diffs the two files on the things that go ON THE WIRE, and
// nothing else. Comments, types, field order and structure are free to differ —
// they already do, by design.

 * The twin moves. It was `slides/src/sync/online.ts`; a kernel refactor is
 * lifting it to `kernel/src/sync/online.ts` and leaving slides a facade. This
 * guard follows it rather than pinning one path, so it keeps working across
 * that move instead of going quiet on the exact day the code is most likely to
 * drift. If neither is a real transport (both facades, or the layout changed
 * again), the rig SAYS SO and fails — a protocol guard that silently finds
 * nothing to compare is worse than no guard, because the green tick is a lie.
