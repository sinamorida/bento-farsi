//
// TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, and only the first is what a CRDT rig usually asks.
//
//  1. DO REPLICAS CONVERGE? Standard, and the engine's own property.
//
//  2. IS WHAT THEY CONVERGE ON A LEGAL bento/spaces DOCUMENT? This is the one
//     that matters here, and it has no slides equivalent. `page.blocks` is
//     FLAT AND IN PRE-ORDER — the format's guarantee is "a child always
//     follows its parent, so one forward pass rebuilds the tree" — while the
//     engine stores order as fractional position keys and `parent` as an
//     ordinary last-writer-wins register. Those are two independent merge
//     domains describing one visual tree. Two perfectly legal concurrent edits
//     (you indent a block, I move one) can therefore converge on a state every
//     replica agrees about and no renderer can draw correctly.
//
//     If that is real, it is a FORMAT-LEVEL decision and it has to be made
//     before any spaces file carries collaboration state — which is why this
//     rig reports it as data rather than asserting a verdict it cannot know.
//
// The engine is the kernel's, bound to ('pages','blocks'). Nothing here is
// spaces app code: this is the shape binding and its evidence.

// The binding lives with the APP (spaces/src/sync/crdt.ts), not here. Two
// definitions of a frozen format constant is precisely how a fork starts: the
// shape strings are minted into every persisted SyncStateJSON and every relay
// frame, so a rig that carries its own copy can go green while the app ships
// something else. Re-exported so existing importers are unaffected.
// (`export … from` re-exports without binding the name locally, and this rig

// Convergence is the ENGINE's property, and it holds. Everything in the table
// above is a property of the FORMAT meeting the engine, and every one of them
// is an open design question this rig exists to have discovered rather than to
// have pre-judged:
//
//  · pre-order vs `parent` — two independent merge domains for one visual
//    tree. The fix is a rule (derive the tree at render time and tolerate any
//    array order, or repair after apply), and a repair that COMMITS would mint
//    ord ops and can ping-pong between replicas forever.
//  · page cycles — `Store.tree()` recurses from the root with no visited set,
//    so a cycle makes pages vanish from the sidebar AND from the markdown
//    export, while still being in the file.
//  · duplicate block ids — the engine duplicates a node on concurrent moves to
//    two different parents, BY DESIGN (docs/collab-design.md). In slides that
//    is the morph idiom and it is correct. In spaces, block ids are unique
//    document-wide (parseDoc's `seen` set spans pages and blocks),
//    `buildIndex` keys blocks by bare id, and `#p/<page>/<block>` anchors
//    assume it — so the same behaviour is a defect.
//
// Failing the build on any of those would be asserting an answer nobody has
// chosen. STRICT=1 turns them into assertions — flip it in CI the moment the
// decisions land, and this rig becomes their enforcement.
