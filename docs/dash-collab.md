# bento/dash collaboration — design, and what it loses

*Design document, August 2026. Status: **engine and rig implemented, and the
rig is green** (`dash/src/sync/crdt.ts`, `scripts/test-dash-sync.ts` — no open
convergence failure, §7); session, transport and People panel implemented but
**not yet mounted by the app** (see "What this
needs from the rest of dash"). Companion to `docs/collab-design.md`, which is
the authoritative spec for the wire protocol, the relay and the key chain —
dash speaks that protocol unchanged. This document covers only what is
different, which is everything below the wire.*

## 1. Why slides' engine does not transfer

`slides/src/sync/crdt.ts` is a good CRDT for a deck: a slide has tens of
elements, each element is a small flat object with a globally-ish unique id,
and the whole document fits comfortably in memory twice over. Two of its load-
bearing assumptions are false for a workbook.

**It diffs whole-document snapshots.** Every commit re-serializes the document
and compares it to a shadow copy. `store.ts` already measured what that costs
here — 10 ms per snapshot on a 12.2 MB workbook, most of a frame, paid in the
frame the user starts typing, and 1.19 GB of live strings for a full undo
stack. That is why dash's history is typed inverses rather than snapshots, and
it is why sync cannot be a differ either.

**It keys state per node, and a workbook has a million of them.** Slides
assigns every element a fractional order key and a birth stamp at adopt time.
A 1M-row sheet doing the same would carry ~1M order keys and ~1M stamps — in
memory, and in the FILE, since `collab.sync` is stamped into the saved
document. The entire columnar-plus-dictionary encoding exists to get a cell
down to 4.8 bytes; a sync layer costing 40 bytes a row would undo it.

So dash's engine is built on two rules that slides does not need:

> **Ops are minted from patches, never from a diff.**
> **State is O(edits), never O(rows).** A row nobody has touched costs zero
> bytes. A cell nobody has written costs zero bytes.

The first rule was free, because `store.ts` already predicted it: *"The same
Patch objects are the undo entries, the future CRDT ops and the agent API."*
A `Patch` is a complete, position-independent description of one mutation, and
`setCells` is already keyed by **rid**, not by row position. That is the single
luckiest fact in this design.

## 2. Node identity

| node | id | why |
|---|---|---|
| the document | `@doc` | title, meta, theme, measures, names, views |
| a sheet | `s␟<sheetId>` | |
| a column | `c␟<sheetId>␟<colId>` | column ids are **sheet-scoped** (`model.ts` is explicit: two sheets may both call a column `c1`), so a bare id is not identity |
| a row | `r␟<sheetId>␟<rid>` | rids are minted at insert and **never reused** (`rowcol.ts` is emphatic), which is exactly what makes them usable as identity |

`␟` is U+001F. It cannot occur in a sheet or column id: import mints column ids
by slugging headers, and `parseDoc` repairs anything it cannot claim.

This is slides' composite-key lesson applied before it could bite. Slides
shipped v1 keyed by bare element id, discovered that the same id on many slides
is the *core morph idiom*, and had to version the wire format to fix it. dash
composites from commit one.

**A cell is not a node.** A cell is a PROPERTY of its row, keyed by column id:
the register `r␟s1␟7 ⟹ v␟price` is the cell at row 7, column `price`. That
gives per-cell last-writer-wins out of exactly the same (lamport, actor)
register machinery slides uses for `x` and `fill`, with no new algebra and no
per-cell state until somebody writes a cell. Cell *overrides* (the `cells`
overlay) are a second key space on the same node, `o␟price`.

---

## 3. Patches → ops

| store patch | op | granularity |
|---|---|---|
| `setCells` | `cell` (many rids, one column) | **per cell**, LWW by (lamport, actor) |
| `setOverrides` | `ovr` | **per cell**, whole-override-object LWW |
| `insertRows` | `rins` (rids + fractional keys + values) | per row |
| `deleteRows` | `rdel` | per row, tombstone |
| `addColumn` | `ins` (metadata) **+** `cell` (its values) | per column |
| `removeColumn` | `del` | tombstone |
| `reorderColumns` | `ord` per moved column | fractional key |
| `setColumn` | `set` per key | **per property** |
| `setSheetProps` | `set` per key (a `drop` becomes `v` absent) | **per property** |
| `setMeasure` | `set` on `measures.<name>` | **per measure** |
| `setTitle` | `set` on `title` | whole value |
| `applySteps`, `refreshBinding` | — | not expressible; the session ships a state snapshot instead of dropping the edit |

Two details in that table are load-bearing.

`setCells` carries `dictLen`, which truncates a dictionary the edit grew. It is
**stripped** when minting: it is a local undo artefact, and applying it to a
peer would truncate a dictionary of a different length. Values are the wire
format; dictionary indices never travel.

A **column insert carries no values**. Its values follow as an ordinary `cell`
op in the same commit. While a column payload assigned cells, every cell had
two possible owners — the column's payload and the row's — and the rig kept
finding deliveries where two replicas disagreed about a number. One writer per
cell, decided by one register, is worth its cost. That cost is real and stated
in §6.

---

## 4. Row order: a fractional index over rids

Row order is data ("in a spreadsheet, order is data" — `store.ts`), so it needs
a real sequence CRDT, and the cheap ones do not fit. Three designs were tried;
the rig killed two.

1. **`rids` as a whole-value LWW register.** Simple, converges, and silently
   drops one side's rows whenever two people edit structure at once. Rejected:
   this is precisely the class of loss the app exists to refuse.
2. **An RGA whose inserts name an ANCHOR RID**, with deleted anchors resolved
   by walking back to the anchor's own anchor. Position-preserving and cheap —
   and wrong: the walk lands a row ahead of rows that used to sit between the
   anchor and its predecessor, so two replicas that applied the deletes in
   different orders disagreed. Found on seed 16 of a 20-seed run.
3. **A fractional index** (shipped). Every row has an order key; order is
   `sort by (key, rid)`, a pure function of converged state. A neighbour may
   die without moving anything, because the key already sits between the
   survivors — no tombstones, no chains.

The trick that makes it affordable: **most rows never get a key.** A row that
came with the file takes its key from its position in the adopted baseline
sequence (`base`, one run-length list per sheet — 20 bytes for 4200 rows).
Only an INSERTED row stores an explicit key. Cost: O(inserts) + O(sheets).

Minted keys are suffixed with the author's actor id. Two replicas inserting
between the same neighbours compute the same midstring, and with equal keys the
sequence each replica materialises depends on which rows it happened to hold —
it stops being sorted, and every later binary search lands somewhere else (seed
42). The suffix makes every key unique, so the sequence is sorted by
construction everywhere.

---

## 5. Concurrent structural edits

**Two people insert rows at the same place.** Both rows survive, ordered by
(key, rid). Deterministic, and the same on every replica.

**Insert vs delete of the neighbour.** The insert keeps its place; the deleted
row leaves. The fractional key does not care that its neighbour died.

**Delete vs edit of the same row.** Delete wins (standard, predictable, and the
same rule slides ships). The edit's register still advances, so states converge.

**Undo of a row delete** is a fresh insert carrying the row's values, which
resurrects the row by out-stamping its tombstone. Values written by others
during the row's dead window are parked and replay if they out-stamp the
resurrection.

**Two people undo the same row delete.** The higher (lamport, actor) wins, and
its insert decides two separate things: where the row sits (its order key) and
what the row's payload says about each column it NAMES. Both are absolute —
a replica that had already put the row back at the loser's key MOVES it, and
a replica that had already applied the loser's payload takes the winner's.

A column the winning insert does **not** name is untouched by it. The two
undoers' documents need not hold the same columns (one may not have heard of a
column the other has), so an insert can only ever claim what it carried; for
everything else the cell's last writer still stands. Both halves of that rule
were bugs before they were rules — see §7.

**Two people add columns.** Both survive; order by fractional key.

**Column delete vs edits inside it.** Delete wins. See §6.

**Sheet delete vs anything inside it.** Delete wins, coarsely. See §6.

---

## 6. What loses data

This is the section to read twice. Everything here is a **documented
limitation**, not a bug: each one is deterministic (every replica loses the
same thing) and each one is a deliberate trade against a cost named beside it.

### 6.1 A cell override is a whole-object register

`{note, bg, bold, align, color, why, by}` is ONE register. Two people
annotating the same cell — one sets a note, the other a colour — and one of
the two edits is lost silently. Cell VALUES do not have this problem; only the
override overlay does. Fixable later by making the override per-key like
`measures.<name>`, at the cost of more registers per annotated cell.

### 6.2 Deleting a column loses concurrent edits to it

A column's death is final for its values. Writes to it during the delete's
flight are dropped (their registers still advance, so replicas agree); undoing
the delete restores the values **the undoer had**, and nobody else's.

Re-adding the column is a whole-column assignment, so it also out-stamps every
write older than itself, wherever that write is being held — in the document, in
a parked stash entry, or in an op still waiting on the buried column. All three
readers apply the same rule (`resetColumnValues`, `reconcileParked` and
`replayStashRow`); the last of those did not, and that was the seed-307 bug.

The converse is equally load-bearing and cost two more bugs (§7): a write NEWER
than the assignment survives it, and the parked copy is the only record of it
that its own AUTHOR has — every other replica still holds the op itself, queued
on the buried column. So nothing may overwrite a parked entry that outranks it.

This is the one place dash refuses to be clever, deliberately. Cell values live
in the document, not in the sync layer, so a resurrected column could only come
back full if each replica restored what IT happened to hold — and no two
replicas hold the same thing, so they came back different. Every attempt to
reconcile those private copies grew another ordering rule and another rig
failure. Delete-wins is convergent and explicable; "everyone keeps their own
version" is neither.

### 6.3 Deleting a sheet beats everything inside it

Ops for a dead sheet's rows and columns are book-kept (registers, births and
tombstones advance so the states converge) and otherwise discarded. Undoing a
sheet delete restores the sheet **as the deleter saw it**; concurrent edits
made elsewhere in that window are gone.

The alternative is a cascade tombstone per row, which is O(rows) in the op, in
memory and in the file — the exact cost this design exists to avoid.

### 6.4 Undo under collaboration

Two prices, both inherited and both real.

*It can revert a collaborator's edit.* Undo replays the inverse patch built
when you made the change, and that inverse restores the value it displaced —
which may since have been overwritten by someone else. Same compromise slides
documents.

*It no longer shrinks a dictionary back.* `setCells`'s inverse carries
`dictLen`, and `applyPatch` honours it by truncating the column's dictionary to
the length the edit found. That is exact for one writer and unsound for two: a
peer's write interns ITS strings into the same dictionary above that watermark,
so the truncation strands them and every cell pointing at one reads back null —
on the undoing replica alone, with no register moving, which is a divergence
rather than a lost undo. `local()` therefore deletes `dictLen` from the patch
before the store sees it. The cost is the orphaned strings, which store.ts
already calls "semantically right and no longer byte-identical"; a live session
had given up byte-identical dictionaries anyway, since two replicas intern in
the order their ops arrive. This was the seed-124 bug.

*It can be refused outright.* An inverse names rows and columns that may no
longer exist, and `committable()` (crdt.ts) refuses patches that name what is
not there. Without that refusal the local store applies the patch anyway — it
has no idea what a peer deleted — while every peer's engine gates it, so the
edit lands on exactly one replica. A refused inverse costs one undo step; the
alternative costs the numbers.

### 6.5 Row ORDER after an offline fork merge

Two copies edited offline and merged by snapshot exchange (rather than by op
log) reconcile their row order by a symmetric interleave — an element only one
side has goes first, and a genuine conflict breaks on (birth stamp, rid). Both
sides land on the same order; it is not necessarily the order either side
intended. Op-based sessions are unaffected: they order by key.

Two copies adopted at *different points* in a file's history disagree about
which rows were baseline. Their baselines are merged (symmetrically) so both
derive the same keys, but a third replica that never merged may order those
rows differently until it exchanges a snapshot too.

### 6.6 Bulk column adds cost one register per cell

Because a column insert carries no values (§3), adding a fully-populated column
mints one cell register per value — a 100k-row column costs ~100k register
entries in the sync state, and in `collab.sync` if the file is saved during the
session. Bulk data arrives through IMPORT in practice, and import creates a
whole SHEET, whose insert carries its rows wholesale for one op.

The session refuses to stamp a sync state larger than `SYNC_STAMP_BUDGET`
(2 MB) into the file. Such a copy rejoins as a fresh adopt: it loses two-way
fork merge and loses nothing else.

### 6.7 Ops too large for the relay

A sheet insert carries the whole sheet. Past the relay's frame ceiling it is
refused, the session drops those exact ops from the resend log (or they loop
forever), and the user is told. The local document keeps the change; peers
never see it. Sharing a workbook whose import exceeds the frame budget means
sending the file, not the ops.

### 6.8 Packed columns do not participate

`enc:'pack'` is an author-chosen archive encoding that `store.ts` refuses to
write into. Row inserts and deletes do not maintain it, so a sheet holding a
packed column should not be edited structurally under collab. Pre-existing in
the store; named here because collab makes it easier to hit.

### 6.9 A spreadsheet cell is keyed by its ADDRESS, so nothing may move one

`kind:'canvas'` cells are properties of the SHEET node keyed by A1 address
(`g␟B7` content, `p␟B7` presentation, `w␟C` a width, `h␟4` a
height), minted from `setCanvasCells` and `setCanvasSizes`. Per-cell LWW, and
the two halves are independent — bolding a cell while someone else retypes it
keeps both. `v` and `f` deliberately share ONE register: split, they would show
a formula from one replica beside a cached number from another, which is a cell
that existed nowhere.

The address is the key because the FILE offers no cell identity. A dataset row
carries a `rid` — minted at insert, never reused, IN the document — which is
what makes `r␟s1␟7` mean the same row on two replicas that have never
spoken. A spreadsheet cell carries only its address, so a minted id would have
to be a stored address→id map: one entry per non-empty cell whether or not
anyone ever edited it, riding in `collab.sync`, which is O(cells) against this
engine's O(edits) invariant.

The cost is stated rather than hidden. A patch that MOVES cells — a row or
column insert, a cut-and-shift, none of which exist today — **cannot** be minted
as cell ops over the addresses it lands on: two replicas shifting concurrently
renumber each other's writes, and no register ordering repairs that. Such a
patch must keep falling through to the snapshot fallback until there is an
explicit shift op that transforms the key space, or a real per-sheet row/column
order (at which point the keys become (rowId, colId) and stop being positions).
`localOne`'s default arm sets `unsynced` for exactly this reason, and the rig
pins it with a hypothetical `insertCanvasRows` that must mint ZERO ops.

Rig: `scripts/test-dash-canvassync.ts` — the spreadsheet's own convergence rig,
separate from `test-dash-sync.ts` on purpose, because this is a different
convergence problem and not a wider one.

### 6.9a A dataset override is TWO registers, for the same reason

`kind:'table'` cell overrides split exactly as §6.9 splits spreadsheet cells:
`o␟<col>` carries the override's CONTENT (`v`, `was`, `f`, `xlsxF`, `froze`,
and the provenance `by`/`at`/`why`/`againstHash`) and `q␟<col>` carries its
PRESENTATION (`format`, `note`, and model.ts's `APPEARANCE_FIELDS` — bold,
italic, underline, wrap, align, colours, borders). Both hang off the ROW node,
as before. `v` and `f` stay in one register together for §6.9's reason.

`OvrOp` therefore carries `m: number[]` beside `keys` and `v`, with the same
meaning `CvCellOp.m` has: the payload is the WHOLE override so a receiver in
any state can apply the claim, and the mask says which halves the write claims.
Bolding a cell while a collaborator retypes it keeps both; as one register it
kept whichever landed second, with the two replicas' sync states in perfect
agreement about the loss.

**`SYNC_V` is 2.** A build that ignores `m` applies the whole payload, which
converges with itself and DIVERGES against one that honours it (the bolder's
op takes the retyper's stale value while the retyper's op drops the bold).
`session.ts` already drops a frame whose `pv` does not match, so the version
bump turns a silent divergence into two replicas that do not speak — the
honest failure. Saved sync state from before it is discarded and the file
rejoins as a fresh adopt, which is the rule §"state+wire are versioned"
already states.

Two holes closed while building it, both older than the split and both
reachable with a single register:

* **`reconcileParked` never weighed the ROW's rebirth.** `replayStashRow` has
  always refused an entry a resurrection out-stamps; the other reader of the
  same stash did not, so an override parked at a row's death came back on
  whichever replica happened to hold the parked copy. Rig seed 520 of
  `SEEDS=800 STEPS=300 ACTORS=4`. Fixed for override keys only — extending it
  to `v␟col` diverged a value at `ACTORS=5` seed 226, and those paths are tuned
  by five closed seeds.
* **A rebirth did not sweep the overrides already in the document.**
  `applyOvr`'s birth gate filtered ops arriving after a resurrection and
  nothing touched the ones that had already landed, so an override written
  between two concurrent resurrections survived on some replicas and not
  others. `applyRins` now calls `supersedeRowOverrides`, the row-axis twin of
  `resetColumnValues`. Pinned by a hand-built three-replica case in
  `scripts/test-dash-cellfmt.ts`, verified to fail when only that call is
  removed.

Rig: `scripts/test-dash-cellfmt.ts` for the split and the two fixes;
`scripts/test-dash-sync.ts` now races override CONTENT against override
PRESENTATION in its random steps (it used to write `{note, bg}` every time, so
the content half was never contended).

**One open, PRE-EXISTING failure**, found by that richer generator and verified
against the unmodified engine: `SEEDS=400 STEPS=300 ACTORS=5` seed 226 diverges
on a cell VALUE. It is not in the override paths; the default configuration —
what CI runs — is green.

### 6.10 `steps` is a whole-array register

`setSheetProps` refuses `steps` (it is structural), so the transform chain
travels only in sheet payloads and snapshots. Two people appending different
steps concurrently is not expressible today.

---

## 7. Convergence rig

`node scripts/test-dash-sync.ts`, modelled on `scripts/test-sync.ts`.
`SEEDS` (a COUNT, default 60) / `STEPS` (160) / `ACTORS` (3) / `SEED_ONLY` /
`DBG_NODE` / `DIFF_WIDTH` / `TRACE_SHAPE` / `TRACE_ORDER`. Write the assignments
INLINE — zsh does not word-split an unquoted `$cfg`, so `env $cfg node …` passes
the whole string as one variable name and silently applies only the first. If two
different configurations report the same check count, the variables are not
reaching the rig.

N simulated replicas mutate through the SAME patches the editor commits, ops
travel over per-(from,to) FIFO queues in random interleavings, and at
quiescence every replica's materialized workbook AND sync state must be
identical. Plus targeted cases: per-cell LWW, dictionary interning, the row
index (concurrent inserts at one place, insert beside a row someone deleted),
delete-wins, undo resurrection with a dead-window edit, column add/remove/
reorder, rid-aligned column data, sheet delete, gap buffering, log catch-up,
two-way snapshot merge of offline forks, and the five hand-built cases named in
the closed-seed accounts below (a column re-added by undo out-stamping a value
parked in its dead window; undo not truncating a dictionary a collaborator grew;
a row resurrected twice taking the winning insert's place; a second
resurrection that does not name a column keeping its value; a row insert not
clobbering a newer value parked for a buried column).

It also asserts, after every single apply on every replica, that **every column
array is exactly as long as the sheet has rows** — columnar storage addresses
cells by position, so a column one entry short returns the next row's number
for every row below the gap, silently. That check found a real store bug (§8).

`TRACE_ORDER=1` adds the second structural invariant, after every apply: **a
sheet's `rids` is sorted by (order key, rid)**. That is the fractional index's
whole contract, and `rowIndexFor` is a binary search that assumes it. One row
left at a stale key does not merely sit in the wrong place — it makes every
later insert on that replica land arbitrarily, which is how a single missed
move becomes a wholly different row order. It is off by default because it
costs a scan per apply; run it whenever anything touches row placement.

Status (all measured on the current engine):

| configuration | result |
|---|---|
| `SEEDS=200 STEPS=200 ACTORS=3` | ALL PASS (23,660 checks) |
| `SEEDS=300 STEPS=250 ACTORS=4` | ALL PASS (24,660 checks) |
| `SEEDS=800 STEPS=300 ACTORS=4` | ALL PASS (27,660 checks) |
| `SEEDS=400 STEPS=300 ACTORS=5` | ALL PASS (26,060 checks) |
| `SEEDS=200 STEPS=250 ACTORS=6` | ALL PASS (24,860 checks) |
| `SEEDS=600 STEPS=400 ACTORS=6` | ALL PASS (28,860 checks) |
| `SEEDS=1000 STEPS=250 ACTORS=6` | ALL PASS (32,860 checks) |
| `SEEDS=120 STEPS=300 ACTORS=7` | ALL PASS (24,300 checks) |
| `TRACE_ORDER=1 SEEDS=100 STEPS=300 ACTORS=7` | ALL PASS (24,060 checks) |
| `TRACE_ORDER=1 SEEDS=300 STEPS=400 ACTORS=8` | ALL PASS (27,060 checks) |

**No open failure class.** Every seed named below is closed, and each has a
hand-built deterministic case in the rig rather than a seed number, verified to
fail when — and only when — its own fix is reverted.

**Seeds 124 and 307.** They looked like one failure class and were two, both
invisible in the sync state (registers, births, tombs, positions and version
vectors all agreed on both sides; only the workbook differed by a cell).

* **124 was not a dead-window bug at all** — the column in question was never
  deleted. It was `dictLen`: an undo truncating a dictionary a collaborator had
  grown, blanking cells the undoer never touched. See §6.4.
* **307 was** the column dead window, in `replayStashRow`: a parked value was
  weighed only against the ROW's rebirth, never against the COLUMN's, so the
  replica whose row came back AFTER the column's undo restored a number that
  every replica reaching the same rebirth through `resetColumnValues` had
  correctly blanked. See §6.2.

**Seed 116 — row ORDER diverged at six actors.** Three replicas materialised
three different sequences while every register agreed. `applyRins`'s
already-here branch recorded the winning insert's order key and left the row
sitting where the LOSING insert had put it. Two actors resurrecting one row
produce two inserts; a replica that received the loser first has the row in the
document when the winner arrives and took that branch, while a replica that
received the winner first placed the row by binary search at the winning key and
discarded the loser at the "an older create" gate. Same `rpos` on both, two
sequences — and then the first replica's `rids` was no longer sorted, so every
later insert compounded it. The branch now MOVES the row (`relocateRow`,
rebuilding the column arrays through `permuteRows`, since a row's values are
addressed by position). Six actors were needed because it takes two concurrent
resurrections of one row plus a later insert to become visible.

**Seeds 374 and 184 — a value dropped by everyone except the second
resurrector.** A row resurrected twice: the first insert's payload named a
column, the second's (from an actor who had not yet heard of that column) did
not. `rnamed` holds only the CURRENT birth's claim, so the winning insert erased
the record that the first had ever claimed the column; the parked value's
authority — the first birth — became unrecognisable, `cellAuth(…, fromRow:false)`
returned the bare cell register (or nothing at all, when the value had only ever
arrived in a row payload), the stale guard saw two different stamps and dropped
it. The author of the second resurrection kept the number because it had never
parked a copy. **The minority replica was right**: an insert makes no claim on a
column it does not name, so nothing superseded the value. `replayStashRow` and
`reconcileParked` now weigh a non-claiming rebirth against the PARKED stamp, and
only something strictly newer displaces it.

**Seed 163 — the same family, found while sweeping the two above.** A write is
parked at its row's death; the row is then resurrected by an insert whose
payload names that column while the column itself is buried, and the "park what
the insert carried" loop overwrote the newer entry with the insert's own older
value. Every replica but one recovers anyway, because the write reached them
while the column was dead and is still queued on the column node — but its
AUTHOR applied it straight into a live document and the parked copy was its only
record, so the author alone lost it. Both park loops (`applyRins`'s and
`settle`'s local twin) now refuse to clobber an entry that outranks the insert,
the rule `parkColumn` has always carried.

---

## 8. What this needs from the rest of dash

None of these are in this task's ownership. Each is small, and each closes a
real hole rather than a stylistic one.

### store.ts

1. ~~**A patch hook.**~~ **DONE.** `store.beforePatch(fn)` is called from
   `commit`, `runEdit` and `invert` with the patches about to be applied and
   may replace the list; `store.afterPatch(fn)` is the other half, since the
   CRDT mints from the PRE-state and settles once the document has moved.
   `invert` passes `substitute: false` — a hook may refuse a patch it cannot
   express, and dropping one there would apply half an inverse and leave the
   undo stack describing a document that no longer exists.

   Undo and redo therefore ship as OPS now rather than a whole state snapshot.
   Measured in two tabs: an edit broadcasts one `ops` frame, the undo
   broadcasts one `ops` frame, and the peer follows both.

2. ~~**`insertRows` must clamp the write.**~~ **DONE.** `applyPatch` clamps the
   write index to the splice position, so an `at` past the end no longer leaves
   a hole and a column longer than the sheet has rows. It was reachable without
   collab too — `window.bento.commit` is a public API.

3. ~~**`deleteRows` should take the row's overrides with it**~~ **DONE.**, as
   `rowcol.deleteRowsAt` does. The inverse of `insertRows` is a bare
   `deleteRows`, so undoing an insert orphans any override added to the row in
   the meantime — on the undoing replica only, since the engine strips them
   everywhere else.
4. ~~**`setOverrides`' inverse should carry `dropEmpty`.**~~ **DONE.** Undoing the removal of
   the last override leaves `cells: {}` behind on the undoing replica while
   every peer receives it through a path that drops the container. Twelve bytes
   in the file, and a diverged document. The engine normalises it; the store
   should not create it.
5. ~~**A public "changed underneath you" event.**~~ **DONE** — `store.changedRemotely()`. Remote ops are applied
   surgically and must not enter undo history, so the session cannot use
   `commit`; it currently calls the private `emit`.

### model.ts

6. **Partitioning the rid space by actor.** Half of this has landed: `sheet.nextRid`
   is a durable monotonic watermark now (`store.ts` raises it on every structural
   edit, `rowcol.nextRidFloor` reads it, and `crdt.settleWatermark` joins the two
   replicas' values with MAX at every settle point, since a plain counter does not
   converge). What is still open is the concurrent case the watermark cannot
   reach: two replicas inserting at the same time both mint the next rid, for
   DIFFERENT rows, and rid is identity. **This must land before collab is
   enabled**; it is the one item on this list that is a correctness precondition
   rather than an improvement. The rig sidesteps it by giving each replica its
   own rid range.

### main.ts

7. Construct the session, mount the panel, connect on eligibility, and stamp
   the state on save — about six lines:
   `const sync = new SyncSession(store)`, `mountPeople(el, sync, store)`,
   `if (sync.shareEligible()) joinFromDoc(sync, store)`,
   `sync.stampInto(store.doc)` before serializing, and `sync.setSheet(id)` when
   the visible sheet changes.

## 9. What is reused, and what is a port

`docs/collab-design.md` is the spec for all of it; dash speaks the same wire
format, so ONE relay serves both apps.

**Reused unchanged (protocol and semantics):** the room-id commitment to the
owner pubkey (`w` + b64url(SHA-256(pub))), the owner→invite→member signature
chain, per-socket verification, owner-signed revocation, the AES-GCM frame
envelope, `?tok` possession proof, the 25-second keepalive ping and its
fast-reconnect, refusal handling, the memory-only replay bookmark, the
BroadcastChannel same-machine transport, the hello/need/ops/p/bye/snap frames,
and dormant-until-shared eligibility.

**Ported, not imported:** `online.ts`. Slides' module reaches into slides'
store, model and update modules, so importing it would pull the whole slides
app into dash's bundle. PLATFORM §9 already names this: the collab engine and
relay are "shared but NOT yet in kernel/", and genericizing them is its own
project. When that project happens, these two files are the callers to
reconcile.

**Written for dash:** the engine (`crdt.ts`), the patch tap and snapshot policy
(`session.ts`), and the People panel (`people.ts`).

## 10. Public surface

```ts
// dash/src/sync/crdt.ts
class DashSync {
  constructor(actor: string)
  adopt(doc: DashDoc): void                      // a document that has never synced
  local(doc: DashDoc, patches: Patch[]): Op[]    // BEFORE the store applies them
  settle(doc: DashDoc): ApplyResult              // AFTER the store applies them
  apply(doc: DashDoc, ops: Op[]): ApplyResult    // remote ops, applied surgically
  mergeSnapshot(doc, rdoc, rstate): ApplyResult  // offline fork / late joiner
  missingFor(log: Op[], vv): Op[]                // peer catch-up
  toJSON(): SyncStateJSON
  static fromJSON(actor, j): DashSync
  get gappedActors(): string[]
  dead(node: string): boolean
  unsynced: boolean                              // a patch it could not express
}
function committable(doc: DashDoc, p: Patch): boolean  // refuse before minting
```

The ordering contract is the only sharp edge: `local()` runs **before** the
store applies the patches (it has to read what a delete displaces, and its
`prev`/anchor bookkeeping only makes sense against the pre-state), and
`settle()` runs **after** (parked remote ops may have been waiting for exactly
what the user just did). `apply()` handles both halves itself.
