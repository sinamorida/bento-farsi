// Row and column STRUCTURE: insert, delete, move, resize, freeze, hide.
//
// EVERY FUNCTION HERE IS A PATCH FACTORY. It reads a sheet and returns what the
// store should commit — it never writes. That is not tidiness: the same Patch
// objects are the undo entries, the future CRDT ops and the agent API
// (store.ts:26-29), so a structural edit that mutated the document directly
// would be an edit with no inverse, no op and no way to undo it. The one
// function that writes is `applySheetProps`, and it is a store CASE BODY rather
// than a helper — it says so where it is declared.
//
// A RID IS NEVER REUSED. Row ids are what overrides (`cells["<colId>:<rid>"]`),
// notes and — soon — CRDT node identity attach to, so handing a fresh row the
// number of a deleted one resurrects the deleted row's corrections onto data
// that has nothing to do with them. That is a wrong number wearing a right
// number's clothes, which is the failure class this app exists to refuse. The
// same reasoning runs down the COLUMN axis and is sharper there, because column
// ids are not random: import mints them by slugging the header (import.ts:270),
// so re-importing a CSV after deleting a column produces the SAME id — and any
// override left behind by that delete lands on the fresh column silently. So a
// delete here takes its overrides with it, in the same commit, so undo restores
// both.
//
// BOUNDS CLAMP, IDENTITY REFUSES. A drag can legitimately run past the end of
// the sheet, so positions, counts and widths are clamped rather than thrown —
// an exception mid-gesture is a broken UI. A duplicate column id, a missing
// column, or column data whose length disagrees with the row count are caller
// bugs that corrupt the file quietly, so those throw. `applyPatch` takes the
// same line ("refusing loudly is the point").

// part of the story — and two people opening one file have to see the same
// grid or they are reading different documents. It rides on the COLUMN, where
// unknown fields survive a round trip (model.ts:90), so a build that has never
// heard of hiding still preserves it.
