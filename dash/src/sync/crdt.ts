// bento-sync for dash — the CRDT engine. Pure data, no DOM, no imports beyond
// the model types and the store's own writer, so the same file runs in the
// browser session layer and in the node convergence rig
// (scripts/test-dash-sync.ts, node --experimental-strip-types).
//
// Design, rationale and the honest list of what LOSES DATA: docs/dash-collab.md.
// Read that before changing anything here.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT slides/src/sync/crdt.ts
//
// Slides' engine keys per-element nodes and diffs two whole-document snapshots.
// Neither transfers. A dash workbook is COLUMNAR and dictionary-encoded: cell
// values live in per-column arrays addressed by ROW POSITION, and the document
// is routinely 10-25 MB. Two consequences set the whole shape of this file:
//
//   1. NO SNAPSHOT DIFFING. `JSON.stringify(doc)` costs ~10 ms on a 12 MB
//      workbook (store.ts measured it, which is why history here is typed
//      inverses rather than snapshots) and a shadow copy doubles resident
//      memory. So ops are minted from the store's `Patch` objects, which are
//      already a complete, position-independent description of every mutation.
//      The store's comment predicted this: "The same Patch objects are the undo
//      entries, the future CRDT ops and the agent API."
//
//   2. STATE MUST BE O(EDITS), NEVER O(ROWS). Anything per-row — an order key,
//      a birth stamp, a shadow value — is multiplied by a million. The saved
//      state also rides in the FILE (`collab.sync`), so O(rows) state would
//      undo the entire point of the 4.8-bytes-per-cell encoding. Therefore a
//      row that nobody has touched costs ZERO bytes here: rows get state only
//      when an op inserts or deletes them, and cells only when an op writes
//      them.
//
// THE ALGEBRA
//
//   - Node identity. `@doc`; `s␟<sheet>`; `c␟<sheet>␟<col>`; `r␟<sheet>␟<rid>`.
//     Column ids are SHEET-scoped (model.ts:478 — two sheets may both call a
//     column `c1`) and so are rids, so both are composite. This is slides'
//     lesson (bare ids collapsed the morph idiom) applied before it could bite.
//
//   - Cells are PROPERTIES OF THE ROW NODE, keyed by column id: register
//     `r␟s1␟7 ⟹ v␟price`. That is per-cell last-writer-wins for free, out of
//     exactly the same (lamport, actor) register machinery slides uses for
//     `x`/`fill`. Cell overrides (the `cells` overlay) are a second key space
//     on the same node, `o␟price`.
//
//   - A SPREADSHEET's cells are properties of the SHEET NODE, keyed by their A1
//     ADDRESS: `s␟c1 ⟹ g␟B7` is the cell at B7, `p␟B7` its formatting, `w␟C`
//     a column width, `h␟4` a row height. A `CanvasSheet` (kind:'canvas') has
//     no rows and no columns to hang a node on — it is a sparse map — so the
//     sheet is the only node there is, and the address is the only key the
//     format offers.
//
//     WHY A POSITION KEY, when a position key is exactly what makes a row
//     insert hard. The choice was made three times over and each answer says
//     the same thing:
//
//       1. THE DOCUMENT SUPPLIES NO CELL IDENTITY. A dataset row carries a
//          `rid` in the FILE — minted at insert, never reused — which is what
//          lets `r␟s1␟7` mean the same row on two replicas that have never
//          spoken. A spreadsheet cell carries nothing but its address. Any
//          identity would have to be MINTED at adoption, and minted identically
//          by every replica of the file, so it would be a function of the
//          address anyway — plus a stored address↔identity map.
//       2. THAT MAP WOULD BE O(CELLS). Invariant 2 above is that state is
//          O(edits) and never O(rows); the map is one entry per NON-EMPTY cell
//          whether anyone edited it or not, and it rides in the FILE
//          (`collab.sync`). A 40k-cell invoice model would carry 40k identities
//          to make a feature nobody has yet correct. The address is free: an
//          untouched cell costs zero bytes here, exactly as an untouched row
//          does.
//       3. NOTHING MOVES A CELL TODAY. `store.ts` has exactly two spreadsheet
//          patches — `setCanvasCells` and `setCanvasSizes` — and neither shifts
//          an address. There is no insert-row, no insert-column, no cut-and-
//          shift on this kind. A position key is only wrong once something
//          moves, and identity bought before then is identity that has to be
//          maintained through every read (`validate.ts`, `preview.ts`,
//          `cellformula.ts` and the format itself all address by A1) for no
//          convergence gained.
//
//     SO THE RULE FOR WHOEVER ADDS THE ROW INSERT, and it is the whole reason
//     this paragraph is long: a patch that MOVES cells cannot be minted as
//     `cvc` ops over the addresses it lands on. Two replicas inserting rows
//     concurrently would each renumber the other's writes and no register
//     ordering can repair it — the write and the shift are not the same kind
//     of event. It needs either an explicit shift op that transforms the key
//     space (and the registers with it, since a register keyed `g␟B7` is a
//     claim about a POSITION), or a per-sheet row/column order of the kind the
//     dataset kind has, at which point the cell keys become (rowId, colId) and
//     stop being positions at all. Until one of those exists, an unhandled
//     patch MUST keep falling through `localOne`'s default arm to the snapshot
//     fallback: coarse and correct beats fine and wrong. The fallback is the
//     safety net for this kind and must be narrowed, never removed.
//
//     TWO REGISTERS PER CELL, not one and not one per field. `v` (the value)
//     and `f` (the formula that produced it) are one fact — splitting them
//     merges a formula from one replica with a cached number from another and
//     shows a cell that never existed anywhere — so they share a register with
//     everything else the cell computes (`g␟`). Presentation (`format`,
//     `color`, `bg`, `bold`, `align`, `note`) is independent of the value in
//     both directions and gets its own (`p␟`), so bolding a cell while someone
//     retypes it keeps both. That is the same split the dataset kind already
//     makes between `v␟col` and `o␟col`, for the same reason.
//
//     Which registers a write CLAIMS is diffed against the pre-state at mint
//     time (`localOne` runs before the store applies), because the patch always
//     carries the whole cell — `cellprops.ts` writes `{...cell, bold:true}` —
//     so the object alone cannot say what changed. The op carries the whole
//     cell too, plus the claim mask, so a receiver in any state can apply it.
//
//   - Row ORDER is a FRACTIONAL INDEX over rids, and the trick that makes it
//     affordable is that most rows never get one. rids are minted at insert
//     and NEVER reused (rowcol.ts is emphatic about this), which is what makes
//     them usable as identity at all. A row that came with the file takes its
//     key from its position in the adopted baseline sequence (`base`, one
//     run-length list per sheet — 20 bytes for 4200 rows), so it costs
//     nothing; only an INSERTED row stores an explicit key, minted between its
//     neighbours' keys. Order is then `sort by (key, rid)`, a pure function of
//     converged state. Cost: O(inserts) + O(sheets).
//
//     Two earlier designs failed here and the rig caught both, which is why
//     the third is spelled out. (1) An LWW register over the whole `rids`
//     list: concurrent structural edits silently drop one side's rows.
//     (2) An RGA whose inserts name an ANCHOR RID, with deleted anchors
//     resolved by walking back to the anchor's own anchor — that walk lands a
//     row ahead of rows which used to sit in between, and two replicas that
//     applied the deletes in different orders disagreed (seed 16 of 20).
//     A fractional key needs neither tombstone nor chain: neighbours may die
//     without moving anything, because the key already sits between them.
//
//   - Sheets and columns are few, so they get slides' fractional `pos` keys
//     verbatim (keyBetween/spreadKey copied below — dash cannot import from
//     slides/, and PLATFORM §9 says genericizing the engine is its own
//     project).
//
//   - Liveness is births vs tombs, highest (l,a) wins — delete beats
//     concurrent edits, an insert is a whole-node assignment that resurrects
//     by out-stamping the tomb. Values displaced during a node's dead window
//     park in `stash` and replay on resurrection only while their register is
//     still the winner. All three rules are slides', which earned them.
//
//   - Delivery is per-actor contiguous `s` with a gap buffer, plus a `pending`
//     buffer for ops naming a node we have not seen yet. Also slides'.
//
// WHAT WRITES THE DOCUMENT. Structural changes and cell writes go through the
// store's own `applyPatch` — deliberately, because rowcol.ts already names the
// failure: "Two copies of one op is how the inverse and the forward drift
// apart." A second row-splicer here would have to know about run-length rids,
// dictionary interning and dictLen truncation, and would silently diverge from
// the local path the first time either changed. Plain property sets are
// assigned directly (there is no patch that can express "delete this key" —
// `setSheetProps` refuses `undefined` on purpose — and the CRDT must be able
// to.)

/**
 * Is this patch safe to commit into a LIVE session?

 * A locally committed patch is applied by the store unconditionally — it has no
 * idea what a peer deleted — while the very same change, arriving as an op, is
 * gated by liveness on every other replica. So an edit naming a row or column
 * that is gone lands HERE and nowhere else, and the workbooks differ by a value
 * only one person can see. `applyPatch` makes it worse for cells specifically:
 * a `setCells` naming an unknown rid is silently skipped rather than refused,
 * so nothing surfaces at the call site either.
 *
 * The rule is the honest one: you cannot edit what is not there. Undo is where
 * this actually bites (its inverses were built against a document state that a
 * collaborator has since changed), which is why the session filters rather than
 * throws — a refused inverse is a lost undo step, and a divergent workbook is
 * worse.
