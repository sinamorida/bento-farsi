// Presence names are CLAIMS, not proofs — anyone can type any name — but the
// KEY beside them is a proof, because the relay verified the owner→invite→

// keyed by pubkey and shows the name as a label, which is the honest way round
// and the one that makes Remove meaningful: removing a name would remove
// nothing, removing a key ends that device's write access in seconds.

// Deliberately a mount function rather than a topbar button: main.ts is not
