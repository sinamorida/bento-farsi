//   The number FORMAT is DOCUMENT data — the author chose two decimal places
//   and a pound sign, and everyone who opens the file must see the same thing,
//   or two people reading one board disagree about what it says.
//
//   The GROUPING and DECIMAL GLYPHS are VIEWER chrome, the same rule locale
//   already follows everywhere else in Bento. A German reader of a British
//   author's workbook should see 1.234,50 for the value the author formatted
//   as #,##0.00 — same number, same precision, their own separators.
//
// So the format string says WHAT to show and the viewer's locale says HOW to
// punctuate it. Getting this backwards either freezes one reader's separators
// into everyone else's file, or lets the author's chosen precision drift.

 * Exported because `TEXT(value, "#,##0.00")` is the same question a column's
 * format field asks, and answering it twice is a bug with a delay on it: the
 * two readings agree on the day they are written and drift on the first edit,
 * after which a column and a formula print the same number differently on the
 * same screen. See `formatNumber`, which is the whole of TEXT.
 *
 * We support the part people actually write — a currency prefix, thousands
 * grouping, and a fixed number of decimals — and ignore the rest rather than
 * pretending. `digits` reports whether the pattern said anything about digits
 * AT ALL, which is what tells a number pattern from a date one (`dd/mm/yyyy`
 * has no `0` and no `#` in it). A caller that cannot format dates needs to
 * REFUSE one rather than print the value unchanged and look like it worked.
