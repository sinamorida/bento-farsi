// Dashboards: a grid of tiles over one workbook, and CROSS-FILTERING.
//
// A dashboard is the app's output surface, not its subject (docs/DECISIONS.md,
// 2026-08-02 — `dash` is DAta SHeets). What makes one worth building is the
// thing a screenshot of six charts is not: click a bar and every other tile
// re-derives against that selection, click again and it lets go.
//
// THREE RULES HOLD THE WHOLE FILE UP.
//
//   1. THE SELECTION IS VIEWER STATE. It goes through `store.view()` — no
//      checkpoint, no dirty flag, no op (store.ts:544, grid.ts:326 is the
//      precedent). Writing a click as a `commit` is the easy mistake and
//      nobody notices until the file dirties itself every time a reader
//      explores it, autosave rewrites the workbook, and — once collab lands —
//      one reader's exploring moves everybody else's dashboard. The LAYOUT is
//      the opposite: it is what the author arranged, so it is document data
//      and travels in the file.
//
//   2. NOTHING IS CACHED. Series are derived at render (chart.ts:5) precisely
//      so a chart cannot disagree with the table beside it, and a cross-filter
//      is the case where a cache would be most tempting and most wrong: a
//      stale tile under a live selection is a chart that is confidently
//      answering a question nobody asked. `deriveTile` is a pure function of
//      (sheet, tile, rows) and is called again for every paint.
//
//   3. NULL IS A CATEGORY, NOT AN EXEMPTION. See `catOf` below. A row with a
//      blank Region is not swept into "North" and not quietly dropped from the
//      dashboard: it is in the "(blank)" category, which is drawn, clickable
//      and selectable like any other. So the categories of a column PARTITION
//      the sheet, and picking every category in turn accounts for every row.
//      The rig proves that as an equality, because it is the kind of thing
//      that silently stops being true.
//
// A TILE NEVER FILTERS ITSELF. The selection carries the id of the tile the
// click came from and a tile skips its own entries. Without that, clicking
// "North" on a region chart leaves a chart with one bar, and there is no way
// back to "South" except an undo the reader does not have — the selection is
// not in the undo stack, by rule 1. Power BI, Tableau and Looker all made the
// same choice; it is not a nicety, it is the difference between a control and
// a trap.
//
// WHAT IS DERIVED WHERE. The grouping arithmetic is chart.ts's `optionFor`,
// called over a PROJECTED sheet holding just the surviving rows. That is
// deliberate: a dashboard puts a chart and a table side by side, so a second
// group-by implementation in this file would be exactly the disagreement rule
// 2 exists to prevent. The aggregates are filter.ts's `summarize` for the same
// reason — it is what the status bar reports, it divides by the values PRESENT,
// and it answers `null` rather than 0 when there is nothing to aggregate.
