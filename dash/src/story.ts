// DATA STORY MODE — a workbook that presents itself.
//
// This is slides' MORPH idea, moved onto data. In slides both frames of a
// transition live in the document, so a shape animates from one slide to the
// next MODEL-driven, with no DOM measuring (slides/src/present.ts). Here both
// frames of a chart live in the document too — not as two copies of the
// numbers, but as two SAVED VIEWS of one dataset. A step names a sheet, a
// filter, a sort, a chart binding, a camera and a caption; the series are
// derived from the sheet at render, exactly as chart.ts derives them. Stepping
// from one to the next interpolates the two derived options, so bars grow and
// shrink to their real new values and the categories slide into their new
// order.
//
// The pitch is the file: Tableau needs a server to do this and Excel has
// nothing like it, and the whole thing runs offline from an attachment someone
// emailed you.
//
// FOUR RULES SHAPE EVERY DECISION BELOW.
//
// 1. A STEP IS DOCUMENT DATA; THE READER'S POSITION IS NOT. The steps travel in
//    the file so everyone sees the same story. Which step you are ON is
//    per-viewer state and lives in the player's closure — the same split
//    store.ts draws between `commit` (document) and `view` (order vector), and
//    the same split slides draws for reduced motion (a VIEWER preference in
//    localStorage, never in the doc — a document whose appearance depends on
//    who opened it is a format-level bug, PLATFORM §8).
//
// 2. SERIES ARE DERIVED, NEVER STORED. chart.ts promoted slides' painful
//    `syncLinkedChart` lesson to a rule: there is no code path that writes
//    series data into the document. A story would be the obvious place to break
//    it — "just snapshot the numbers for each step" — and that is exactly how a
//    presentation ends up disagreeing with the table behind it. Every step
//    re-derives from the sheet through `optionFor`, so editing a cell moves
//    every step of the story at once.
//
// 3. A NUMBER NEVER ANIMATES THROUGH A VALUE THAT IS NOT IN THE DATA. Zero is
//    such a value. `morphOption` interpolates numeric leaves and CUTS
//    everything else, so a gap (null) stays a gap for the whole tween and never
//    slides to or from the axis. See the long note on `morphOption`, and the
//    MEASURED renderer limitation recorded on `canMorph` — which is why a
//    line chart refuses a morph that a bar chart accepts.
//
// 4. PRESENTING MUTATES NOTHING. The player computes its own order vectors and
//    its own options; it never calls `store.commit`, never writes
//    `store.order`, and never touches the grid. Closing the overlay leaves the
//    workbook byte-identical to how it opened.
//
// WHAT DOES NOT PRESENT YET, and why, is recorded at the bottom of this file
// under KNOWN GAPS rather than left for someone to discover.

// --- KNOWN GAPS --------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Written down rather than left to be discovered:
//
//  * THE 3D CAMERA CUTS; IT DOES NOT FLY. `mountViz3d` builds its camera
//    internally (`frameCamera(scene, opts)`) and returns only a teardown, so
//    there is no handle to tween. A step's `camera` is applied at mount, which
//    is a cut. Flying it needs viz3d.ts to hand back the `Orbit` and a redraw
//    request; remounting per frame would recompile shaders and rebuild every
//    buffer sixty times a second, which is not a transition, it is a stall.
//  * A 3D STEP IGNORES ITS FILTER. `buildScene` reads the sheet's columns
//    whole. Narrowing it honestly needs the same `computed`-map trick the 2D
//    path uses, which needs `buildScene` to accept an order vector.
//  * HIGHLIGHT IS NAMED, NOT PAINTED. charts-lite colours by SERIES, not by
//    item, so a subset cannot be tinted inside one series. The two workarounds
//    are both worse than saying so: splitting into two series halves every bar
//    (grouped-bar layout reserves a slot per series) and, for a line or
//    scatter, writes nulls that the renderer draws as a plunge to zero. So the
//    highlighted values are listed under the caption and the chart is left
//    truthful.
//  * LINE AND SCATTER STEPS CUT when a filter changes the categories. See
//    `canMorph`.
