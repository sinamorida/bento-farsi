// Self-update: a shipped Bento file asks the release origin whether a newer
// app shell exists — automatically at launch (per-browser opt-out in the
// About dialog) or on demand — and rebuilds itself as "same document, newer
// app": the data block re-spliced into the fetched shell via the exact
// machinery every save already uses.
//
// Trust model (see docs/architecture.md):
// - The manifest is SIGNED (ECDSA P-256 / SHA-256) with an offline key; the
//   matching public key is embedded below in every shipped shell. A
//   compromised host or repo cannot forge a release without that key.
// - The manifest pins the new shell's sha256; the download is hashed and
//   compared before anything is spliced.
// - Only strictly NEWER versions are ever offered (no downgrade replay).
// - A check is a bare GET: no identifiers, no telemetry, nothing about the
//   user or the document. The launch check can be disabled (autoCheckEnabled).
//
// The result is always a NEW downloaded file — the update flow never touches
// the file on disk, so the original is its own rollback.
