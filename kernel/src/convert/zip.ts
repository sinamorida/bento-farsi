// A minimal ZIP reader and writer — the container .xlsx, .pptx and .docx
// are all made of. Lifted verbatim from dash/src/zip.ts (which now re-exports
// it) when the convert engine became its second consumer.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A DEPENDENCY. The shell ships as one
// self-contained HTML file and the whole app is ~98 KB compressed. JSZip is
// ~100 KB and SheetJS is larger than the entire product, so either one doubles
// the file every user downloads in order to open a format most of them will
// never touch. What .xlsx actually needs from ZIP is a fraction of the spec: a
// few dozen small parts, DEFLATE or stored, no encryption, no spanning, no
// streaming producer. That fraction is this file, and the browser already
// carries the expensive half — `DecompressionStream`/`CompressionStream`
// ('deflate-raw') are the same primitives the compressed-shell loader boots on,
// so the baseline is established and costs us nothing.
//
// THE READER TRUSTS THE CENTRAL DIRECTORY, NOT THE LOCAL HEADERS, and that is
// the single decision that makes a hand-written reader survive real files.
// A writer that does not know a part's size in advance (every streaming
// producer — which is most server-side xlsx generators) sets general-purpose
// bit 3, writes zeroes for crc/sizes in the local header, and appends a data
// DESCRIPTOR after the compressed bytes. Reading sizes from the local header
// then yields zero, and the naive fix — scanning forward for the next signature
// — collides with compressed data that happens to contain those four bytes.
// The central directory always has the true sizes. The local header is read for
// exactly one thing: its name and extra-field lengths, which give the offset
// where the data begins, and which may legitimately DIFFER from the central
// copy's (Excel itself writes a Zip64 extra field in one and not the other).
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: encryption (an encrypted xlsx must be refused,
// loudly, not half-read), multi-disk archives (a floppy-era feature), ZIP64
// WRITING (we would have to be emitting >4 GB from a browser tab, which the
// document budget rules out long before), and CP437 filename decoding — every
// part name inside an OPC package is ASCII by specification, so UTF-8 decodes
// it correctly whether or not the flag bit is set.
