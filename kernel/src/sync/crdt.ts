//
// Design: docs/collab-design.md. Summary of the algebra:
//   - identity: slides key by their id; ELEMENTS key by the composite
//     `slideId U+001F elementId` (elKey) — the same element id on many
//     slides is the format's core morph idiom (data-flip-id pairing), so
//     each per-slide copy must be its own CRDT node. The doc format never
//     sees composite keys (element `id` stays the bare morph id); they
//     live in this layer's registers and on the wire. A cross-slide move
//     changes the key, so the differ emits del(old)+ins(new) — concurrent
//     moves of one element to two slides duplicate it (both users keep
//     their copy) instead of racing. `@doc` is the document's namespace.
//   - per-(node, key) LWW registers ordered by (lamport, actorId).
//   - order + parentage: one `pos` register per node (fractional base-62 key
//     + parent id) — arrays in the doc are always *materialized* pos-order.
//   - liveness: `births[id]` (stamped by ins) vs `tombs[id]` (stamped by del),
//     highest (l,a) wins. Delete beats concurrent edits; undo-of-delete is a
//     fresh ins carrying the full node, which resurrects by out-stamping the
//     tomb. A slide delete cascades to the elements the deleter saw (listed
//     in the op); concurrently inserted/moved-in elements survive in `limbo`
//     until re-parented.
//   - delivery: ops carry a per-actor contiguous sequence `s`; the version
//     vector is per-actor max-contiguous-seq, gaps are buffered in `gap`.
//   - text (M3): element.html upgrades to a token RGA on first concurrent
//     text edit ("seed" travels with the first txt op); plain `set html`
//     with a newer (l,a) resets the RGA (LWW compat with old clients).
//
// Convergence argument: every mutation is a join-semilattice merge (register
// max by (l,a), liveness max, RGA insert) applied under causal-enough
// delivery (per-actor FIFO via `s`, cross-actor buffering via `pending`).
// The rig replays random op interleavings across replicas and asserts
// identical materialized documents.

/**
 * WHICH KEYS HOLD THE TWO CONTAINER LEVELS.
 *
 * The engine's algebra — composite node keys, fractional position keys,
 * per-(node,key) registers, the token RGA over `html` — has nothing to do with
 * slides. Only the two property names do: the doc key holding the parent array
 * (`slides`) and the parent key holding the child array (`elements`).
 * bento/spaces has the same two levels under different names (`pages`,
 * `blocks`), so naming them is the whole of what it takes for one engine to
 * serve both apps.
 *
 * BOUND AT MODULE LEVEL, NEVER SERIALIZED, NEVER ON THE WIRE. A room is
 * single-app by construction (the room id is minted per file), so no frame
 * ever has to say which shape it came from — and putting a shape tag in
 * SyncStateJSON would change the bytes of every bento/slides file already on
 * a disk. That constraint is not a style preference: scripts/test-sync-equiv.ts
 * asserts byte-identity against the engine as shipped, and a `state-key-order`
 * mutant exists precisely to prove the comparator notices.
 *
 * The WIRE VOCABULARY is deliberately not parameterized. Ops keep saying
 * `kind:'slide'|'element'` and carrying `sl`/`el` for every app: renaming them
 * per app buys prettier debug output and costs a second binding on the
 * highest-consequence bytes in the system.
