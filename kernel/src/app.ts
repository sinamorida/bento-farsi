// Only three values are app-specific across the whole kernel: the id the

// a fork that runs its own release channel and relay: the signing public key
// and the default sync host. Absent, the platform defaults apply unchanged.
//
// Deliberately NOT a general "kernel init" — modules that need no config
// (anim, charts) take none, so there is no import-order trap and no false
// coupling for apps that skip a module. `autosave` is the one exception and
// reads appConfig() LAZILY, inside openDb(), for exactly that reason: its
// IndexedDB database is named per app, and resolving that at module scope
// would make importing it before configureApp() throw.

 * this document is old enough to predate `pickerIdFor` (#213). Before that,
 * every save — including "Save a copy…" — sent `bento-doc`, so acting on the id
 * there overwrites the open document. The host therefore refuses to write in
 * place unless the runtime says it is at least 1.0.15.
 *
 * It used to read that from `window.bento.updates.version`, which each app
 * assembles by hand — and **bento/dash does not include `updates` at all**, so
 * every ⌘S in Dash fell back to a destination prompt even with a folder
 * granted. The bug is not that Dash forgot; it is that the signal lived in a
 * per-app object at all. Every app calls `configureApp`, so the version is
 * announced here, once, and the next app gets it without knowing this exists.
 *
 * Deliberately a plain string on `window`, not a getter or an object: a host
 * reads it from the page's world through a content script, and the simplest
 * possible value is the one least likely to be mangled crossing that boundary.
