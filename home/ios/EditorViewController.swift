/// Hosts one open deck in a WKWebView and bridges saving to UIDocument.
///
/// TWO decisions here carry the design:
///
/// 1. The document is served through a CUSTOM SCHEME, never `loadFileURL`. A
///    file:// page in WKWebView gets an opaque, unstable origin, which makes
///    localStorage and IndexedDB unreliable — that would silently break the
///    autosave backstop, the per-device collab member key, and the language and
///    reduce-motion preferences. A custom scheme is a stable secure origin, and
///    it keeps cross-origin fetches to the sync relay well-defined rather than
///    arriving as `Origin: null`.
///
///    The host is PER DOCUMENT, derived from the file's own path, not a single
///    shared `deck`. This app opens ANY self-contained HTML document, not only
///    Bento's, so a shared origin would let one document read another's
///    localStorage and IndexedDB — fine when every file is yours, a real leak
///    between unrelated third-party apps. Derived rather than random because
///    the origin IS the storage boundary: a fresh host per launch would wipe
///    that storage on every open. The trade is that moving or renaming a file
///    gives it a new origin and orphans its local state; that state is a
///    cache-and-backstop, never the document itself, which is why this is the
///    right way round.
///
/// 2. The web content is the DOCUMENT'S OWN runtime. The app bundles no shell
///    for rendering and has no opinion about which version a deck carries, so a
///    deck self-updates through Bento's normal signed channel and iOS users get
///    the same release as everyone else on the same day — no App Store
///    submission per release, no drift. What the app ships is file access.
